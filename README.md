#Project1 : New Zeland Weather
* The following is an analysis of the weatherData data set. The weatherData data set contains data on the recorded weather variables for a number of cities including Chicago, Beijing, and Auckland to name a few. All of the data in the data set being used is from the year 2016. All temperature in this analysis is in Fahrenheit. This analysis focuses on the temperature data of the city of Auckland New Zealand. Auckland has a population of close to 1.5 million and is located on the Northern side of the Island. Both the low and average temperatures are visualized to gain an understanding of the weather patterns of Auckland. New Zealand is in the temperate maritime zone and experiences seasonal changes. This means it has a climate typical of the pacific islands without spending extended periods of time in extreme temperatures. It is expected that Auckland falls into a temperate climate, but New Zealandâ€™s diverse landscape could show a variance in comparison to the rest of the Island.
